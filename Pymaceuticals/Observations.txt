Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of your notebook.

1. Since the p-value is 0.84, we can see there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumour size.
We can say that the heavier the mouse, the bigger the tumour size will be.

2. Capomulin treatment seems to be very effective as evident with the treatment with mouse 'b128'.
During the 45 days, we can see that the tumour size decreases slowly during the early stages and faster towards the end of the cycle. 

3. In the summary, we can see that Capomulin and Ramicane were tested the most on the mouses compared to the other drug regimens.
On the other hand, Propriva was tested the least.
